Attempting to write a NES emulator in Rust

I have never written an emulator before, and Rust is a fairly new language to me. So I am very much
a beginner. This isn't a project where finishing is the goal, the main point is to learn.
If this project helps you write your own emulator or learn Rust, then even better.
